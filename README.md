# Localenv Example

An example "hello world" application built for the purpose of demonstrating how to use [`localenv`](https://github.com/jroman00/localenv)

## Getting Started

This application is not intended to be used on its own and should only be used as part of the [`localenv`](https://github.com/jroman00/localenv) ecosystem. See the [localenv installation instructions](https://github.com/jroman00/localenv/blob/master/README.md) to get started

## Scripts

### Running a Shell

Once running via [`localenv`](https://github.com/jroman00/localenv), connect to the running container via:

```
docker-compose exec localenv-example sh
```
